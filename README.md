## My final project for CS50 Intro to Python class

### Project about Bitcoin return calculation at a given time interval.

##### My project is about calculating a return of BTCUSD at 2 different times. 

##### When you compile it with an argument specifying the number of minutes of time interval to calculate. 

##### The return is calculated from the current price at the moment of price calculation and then after a given minute of time, get another price and calculate BTCUSD return. 

##### I use three functions, a function to get a bitcoin price using JSON library, a program to wait for a specified number of seconds using time library, and a function to calculate return.
